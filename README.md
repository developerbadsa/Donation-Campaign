In this website, state management is crucial to ensure that user interactions, such as selecting courses and updating the cart, are handled smoothly. Here's an overview of how state management is implemented:

1. **JSON Data**: The website starts by loading course data from a JSON file. This data is the foundation for displaying course information.

2. **Course Cards**: Based on the JSON data, course cards are dynamically generated and displayed on the webpage. Each card includes course details and a "Select" button.

3. **Cart Management**: When you click the "Select" button on a course card, an `onClick` function is triggered. This function, defined in the `app.jsx` file, receives the course data as a parameter. It then performs the following actions:
   
   - Validates the selected course based on certain conditions (e.g., duplicate selection, credit limit).
   
   - Updates the cart section on the right side of the page with the selected course information, total price, total credit, and remaining credit.
   
   - If there are any validation issues, it displays a warning message (e.g., toast) to notify the user.

4. **Responsive Design**: The website has been designed responsively, using media queries and flexible layout techniques to ensure that it adapts well to various screen sizes, including desktop, mobile, and tablet.

By effectively managing the state of selected courses, this website provides a user-friendly experience for browsing and registering for courses. Whether you're using it on a large desktop monitor or a small mobile device, you can easily select courses and track your registration details.

We hope you find this Course Registration website convenient and user-friendly. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out for assistance. Happy course registration!
